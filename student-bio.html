                    CONDENSER OF THE CHILLER IS COOLED BY COOLING TOWER, HENCE KNOWN AS WATER CHILLER PLANT. 
                    CHILLERS GENERATE COOL WATER TO PROVIDE AIR CONDITIONING TO BUILDINGS
                    CHILLED WATER (6C) IS PRODUCED IN THE EVAPORATOR OF THE CHILLER AND  WATER (12C) COMING FROM AHUS TO THE EVAPORATOR  
                    WILL RELEASE THE HEAT TO THE CONDENSOR VIA REFRIGERANT.
                    EVAPORATOR AND CONDENSOR ARE COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER.
                    CONDENSED WATER(32C) ( WATER THAT HAS PICKED UP HEAT) WILL BE TRANSFERRED BACK TO THE COOLING TOWER WITH THE USE OF A PUMP
                    FANS INSIDE THE COOLING TOWER DISSIPATE THE EXCESSIVE HEAT AND RETURNS ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER BACK (27C) TO THE CONDENSOR
                    THIS WATER WILL AGAIN PICK UP HEAT FROM THE WATER COMING BACK FROM THE AHUS TO THE EVAPORATOR VIA REFRIGERANT. 
                    AND THE CYCLE CONTINUES.
